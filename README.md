### Overview

Getting Married? I just did. And just about anyone can tell you how expensive planning one is these days. My wife and I had to budget, save, and come up with outside the box ways to have our dream wedding, all the while keeping costs low. One of the ways we thought we could trim the fat was by buying used wedding items and tailoring them to our needs. 

We tried looking on many different platforms: Facebook Marketplace, Pinterest, Ebay, even Craigslist, but there wasn’t a good way to sift through the thousands of other items we didn’t need. That’s why I want to create a marketplace specifically built with engaged couples, and newlyweds, in mind. Not only can engaged couples find those perfect used centerpieces for their tables, but we can connect them with newlyweds that are looking to sell those centerpieces that they will never use again. It’s a win-win!
